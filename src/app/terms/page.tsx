            Cancellations are governed by the cancellation policy applicable to your booking, which
            is displayed to you before you confirm and pay. Refund eligibility and amounts depend on
            how far in advance you cancel.
          </li>
          <li>
            Eligible refunds are processed back to your original payment method through Razorpay and
